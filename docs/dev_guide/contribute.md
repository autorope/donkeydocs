# Contribute to Donkey

Donkey is an open source project to help accelerate the development of
self driving autos.

There is a very good explanation of the DonkeyCar software architecture and theory [here](https://robocaresslingen.github.io/BookDownDocu/donkeyCarSoftwareAnalysis.html#how-to-add-parts-to-a-vehicle)

## Guiding Development Principles

* **Modularity**: A self driving system is composed of standalone,
independently configurable components that can be combined to make a car.
* **Minimalism**: Each component should be kept short (<100 lines of code).
Each piece of code should be transparent upon first reading. No black magic,
it slows the speed of innovation.
* **Extensibility**: New components should be simple to create by following a
template.
* **Python**: Keep it simple.

***These guidelines are nearly copied from [Keras](http://keras.io),
   because they are so good***

## Add a part

Are you a hardware specialist that can write a donkey part wrapper for a
GPS unit or a data scientist that can write an recursive neural net autopilot?
If so please write a part so other people driving donkeys can use the part. How do parts work? Check out [this overview](/parts/about)

## Fix or report a bug

If you find a problem with the code and you know how to fix it then please
clone the repo, make your fix, and submit your pull request.

## Reply to issues

Helping close or triage the issues is a good way to help.

## If You Need An Inspiration

Search the code or docs for `TODO` to find places where you might be able
to find a better solution.

## Improve the documentation

You can fix grammar or provide clarity by clicking the the *Edit on GitHub*
link in the top right corner. Here's [a guide](/docs/dev_guide/docs) to how to create and edit docs.
