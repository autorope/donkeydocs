# Tests

There is a limited test suite to ensure that the your changes to the code
don't break something unintended.

## Run all the tests

Run `pytest` from the `donkeycar` project directory. 

## Code Organization

The test code is in `tests` foders in the same folder as the code. This is to
help keep the test code linked to the code its self. If you change the code,
change the tests. :)
