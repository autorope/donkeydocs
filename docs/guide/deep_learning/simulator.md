# Donkey Simulator

The [Donkey Gym](https://github.com/tawnkramer/gym-donkeycar) project is a OpenAI gym wrapper around the [Self Driving Sandbox](https://github.com/tawnkramer/sdsandbox/tree/donkey) donkey simulator (`sdsandbox`). When building the sim from source, checkout the `donkey` branch of the `sdsandbox` project. 

The simulator is built on the the [Unity](https://unity.com/) game platform, uses their internal physics and graphics, and connects to a donkey Python process to use our trained model to control the simulated Donkey.

## Installation Video:

Here's some videos to help you through the installation.

## My Virtual Donkey

There are many ways to use the simulator, depending on your goals. You can use the simulator to get to know and use the standard Donkeycar drive/train/test cycle by treating it as virtual hardware. You will collect data, drive, and train using the __same commands__ as if you were using a real robot. We will walk through that use-case first.

## Install

* Download and unzip the simulator for your host pc platform from [Donkey Gym Release](https://github.com/tawnkramer/gym-donkeycar/releases).
* Place the simulator where you like. For this example it will be ~/projects/DonkeySimLinux. Your dir will have a different name depending on platform. 
* Complete all the steps to [install Donkey on your host pc](install_software.md#step-1-install-software-on-host-pc).
* Setup DonkeyGym:

```bash
cd ~/projects
git clone https://github.com/tawnkramer/gym-donkeycar
cd gym-donkeycar
conda activate donkey
pip install -e .[gym-donkeycar]
```

* You may use an existing ~/mycar donkey application, or begin a new one. Here we will start fresh: 

```bash
donkey createcar --path ~/mysim
cd ~/mysim
```

* Edit your myconfig.py to enable donkey gym simulator wrapper, replace `<user-name>` and the other parts of the path:

```bash
DONKEY_GYM = True
DONKEY_SIM_PATH = "/home/<user-name>/projects/DonkeySimLinux/donkey_sim.x86_64"
DONKEY_GYM_ENV_NAME = "donkey-generated-track-v0"
```


> Note: your path to the executable will vary depending on platform and user.
>  Windows: DonkeySimWin/donkey_sim.exe
>  Mac OS: DonkeySimMac/donkey_sim.app/Contents/MacOS/donkey_sim
>  Linux: DonkeySimLinux/donkey_sim.x86_64


## Drive

You may use all the normal commands to manage.py at this point. Such as:

```bash
python manage.py drive
```

This should start the simulator and connect to it automatically. By default you will have a web interface to control the donkey. Navigate to [http://localhost:8887/drive](http://localhost:8887/drive) to see control page.

On Ubuntu Linux only, you may plug in your joystick of choice.
If it mounts as `/dev/input/js0` then there's a good chance it will work.
Modify myconfig.py to indicate your joystick model and use the `--js` arg to run.

```bash
python manage.py drive --js
```

As you drive, this will create a tub of records in your data dir as usual.

## Train

You will not need to rsync your data, as it was recorded and resides locally. You can train as usual:

```bash
donkey train --tub ./data --model models/mypilot.h5
```

## Test

You can use the model as usual:

```bash
python manage.py drive --model models/mypilot.h5
```

Then navigate to web control page. Set `Mode and Pilot` to `Local Pilot(d)`. The car should start driving.

## Sample Driving Data

Here's some sample driving data to get you started. [Download this](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1A5sTSddFsf494UDtnvYQBaEPYX87_LMp) and unpack it into your data dir. This should train to a slow but stable driver.

## API

Here's some info on the api to talk to the sim server. Make a TCP client and connect to port 9091 on whichever host the sim is running. The server sends and receives UTF-8 encoded JSON packets. Each message must have a "msg_type" field. The sim will end all JSON packets with a newline character for termination. You don't have to end each packet with a newline when sending to the server. But if it gets too many messages too quickly it may have troubles. Check the player log file for JSON parse errors if you are having troubles.
